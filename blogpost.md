cd
=========

**1:** ![Image](Screenshot (4).png)

* Working directory: Home directory


* Output: I get no output because since there's no argument I am not changing my working directory to anything.


* Addressing Feedback: If I am in another directory that is not the home directory, typing cd without argument will move my directory back one directory

* Working directory: Home directory


* Output: The output is changing my working directory to lecture1 because I put lecture1 as the argument.

**3:** ![Image](Screenshot (4).png)

* Working directory: Lecture1 directory


* Output: I get an error and a message saying argument not a directory because I cannot change the directory to a file.

ls
=========

**1:** ![Image](Screenshot (3).png)

* Working directory: Home directory


* Output: I get lecture1 as my output because when I ls with no argument, it will list all the files in my working directory, and since my working directory is the home directory it lists lecture1 as my output.

* Working directory: Home directory


* Output: I get a list of files within lecture1 as output because when I ls with the lecture1 directory, it will list all the files within the lecture1 directory.

* Working directory: Home directory


* Output: I get the same output as my argument because there's no file within the argument file, so it will output whatever argument I put after ls.

cat
=========

**1:** ![Image](Screenshot (5).png)

* Working directory: lecture1 directory


* Output: I get an error because there's no argument following cat therefore, it does not know where to read data.


* Addressing Feedback: If I type something and hit enter after running cat with no argument, the terminal will print out whatever I type and move on to the next line.

**2:** ![Image](Screenshot (5).png)

* Working directory: lecture1 directory


* Output: I get a message saying the argument I put after cat is a directory therefore it would not read the data instead it just prints out a message saying it's a directory.

**3:** ![Image](Screenshot (5).png)

* Working directory: lecture1 directory


* Output: I get a hello world translated in Chinese because I put a file as my argument after cat and so it prints out whatever the text is within the file where in this case, it's hello world in Chinese.
