cd
=========

**1:** ![Image](Screenshot (4).png)

* Working directory: Home directory


* Output: I get no output because there's no argument therefore I am not changing my working directory to anything.

**2:** ![Image](Screenshot (4).png)

* Working directory: Home directory


* Output: I didn't get any output because all I did was change my working directory to lecture1

**3:** ![Image](Screenshot (4).png)

* Working directory: Lecture1 directory


* Output: I get an error because my argument is a file instead of a directory 

ls
=========

**1:** ![Image](Screenshot (3).png)

* Working directory: Home directory


* Output: I get lecture1 as my output because when I ls with no argument, it will list all the files in my working directory and since my working directory is the home directory it lists lecture1 as my output.

**2:** ![Image](Screenshot (3).png)

* Working directory: Home directory


* Output: I get a list of files within lecture1 because when I ls with the lecture1 directory, it will list all the files within the lecture1 directory.

**3:** ![Image](Screenshot (3).png)

* Working directory: Home directory


* Output: I get the same output as my argument because there's no file within the argument file, so it will output whatever argument I put after ls.

cat
=========

**1:** ![Image](Screenshot (5).png)

* Working directory: lecture1 directory


* Output: I get an error because there's no argument following cat therefore, it does not know where to read data.

**2:** ![Image](Screenshot (5).png)

* Working directory: lecture1 directory


* Output: I get a message saying the argument I put after cat is a directory therefore it would not read the data instead it just prints out a message saying it's a directory.

**3:** ![Image](Screenshot (5).png)

* Working directory: lecture1 directory


* Output: I get a hello world translated in Chinese because I put a file as my argument after cat and so it prints out whatever the text is within the file where in this case, it's hello world in Chinese.
